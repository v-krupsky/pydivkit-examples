# pydivkit-examples
Python examples for DivKit.

These examples follow the examples in the DivKit documentation **literally**:
https://divkit.tech/playground?samples=1
and produce output that is identical to the JSON of the DivKit examples 
(except the order of the keys in the JSON output may be different).

Tested with **pydivkit 29.3.0** and Python 3.11.
